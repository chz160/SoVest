                <p>After becoming interested in investing at an early age, Nate and Nelson started an investment club at their Alma Mater. During this time, WallStreetBets, a subreddit dedicated to sharing stock and option adive and wins was becoming extremely popular due to the Game Stop short squeeze. Before the massive influx of users, genuinely good information and research could be found on WallStreetBets, but with the massive influx of users, it has become more
                about to Pump and Dump schemes rather than sharing quality information. SoVest has been created to give people looking for quality research a place to go, where it is impossible to fall victim to pump and dumps, because the Contributor's reputation is tied to every post.</p>
