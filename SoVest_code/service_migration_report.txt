Pending Manual Tasks:
------------------
- Manual task: Verify that AuthServiceInterface contains all required methods from AuthService
- Manual task: Update AuthService implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that DatabaseServiceInterface contains all required methods from DatabaseService
- Manual task: Update DatabaseService implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that PredictionScoringServiceInterface contains all required methods from PredictionScoringService
- Manual task: Update PredictionScoringService implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that ResponseFormatterInterface contains all required methods from ResponseFormatter
- Manual task: Update ResponseFormatter implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that SearchServiceInterface contains all required methods from SearchService
- Manual task: Update SearchService implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that StockDataServiceInterface contains all required methods from StockDataService
- Manual task: Update StockDataService implementation with latest methods from original service
- Manual task: Verify that ValidationServiceInterface contains all required methods from ValidationService
- Manual task: Update ValidationService implementation with latest methods from original service


Next Steps:
----------
1. Review the generated interface and implementation files
2. Copy method implementations from original services to the new ones
3. Update service implementations to use dependency injection
4. Add dependency injection properties and parameters to constructors
5. Register the new services in bootstrap/container.php
6. Update the ServiceFactory to use the new service implementations
7. Gradually update controllers to use interfaces instead of concrete implementations
8. Replace direct getInstance() calls with DI where possible
