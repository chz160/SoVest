## Regression Testing

After any significant changes, run a subset of the above tests focusing on:
1. Core user flows (authentication, search, prediction creation)
2. Recently modified features
3. Features with dependencies on modified components

## Test Data

- Create a set of test user accounts with varying reputation scores
- Initialize a set of stocks with historical price data
- Create test predictions in various states (active, completed, evaluated)
- Generate sample votes and interaction data

## Test Execution Schedule

1. Run unit tests automatically on every commit
2. Run integration tests before each merge to main branch
3. Run full test suite before each production deployment
4. Perform security testing quarterly
5. Conduct usability testing with each major UI change

## Test Reporting

For each test execution:
1. Document test date and version tested
2. Record pass/fail status of each test case
3. Document any bugs or issues discovered
4. Track resolution of issues
5. Maintain a test coverage report

## Continuous Improvement

After each testing cycle:
1. Review test cases for relevance
2. Update tests based on new features
3. Automate additional tests where possible
4. Analyze common issues and implement preventive measures
