				Here's a list of why I love lists:	
				<ul>																			<!-- The <ul> tag creates an unordered list of items -->
					<li>They're really easy to read</li>										<!-- The <li> tag creates list item on that list -->
					<li>They're a great way to organize information</li>
					<li>They're a lot of fun!</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an ORDERED list of why I love lists:
				<ol>																			<!-- The <ul> tag creates an ordered list of items -->
					<li>They're even easier to read</li>
					<li>They're an even greater way to organize information</li>
					<li>They're even more fun!</li>
				</ol>

				How about an example of tables? Those are fun, right?
				<table>																			<!-- The <table> tag starts a table -->
					<tr>																		<!-- The <tr> tag creates a new row of data -->
						<th>First Name</th>														<!-- The <th> tag creates header item in the table -->
						<th>Last Name</th>
						<th>Occupation</th>
					</tr>																		<!-- The </tr> tag ends the row of the table -->
					<tr>																		<!-- This <tr> starts a new row of data on the table -->
						<td>Tony</td>															<!-- The <td> tag creates a field of data on the table -->
						<td>Stark</td>
						<td>Entrepreneur</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Steve</td>
						<td>Rogers</td>
						<td>Soldier</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Bruce</td>
						<td>Banner</td>
						<td>Scientist</td>
					</tr>
				</table>																		<!-- Look at how nicely all these tags are nested and appropriately closed -->
